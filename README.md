# Bash Scripts:
This repository has some basic bash scripts that I created.

# All is Well Version 2.0:
Tired of typing update and more upgrade-autoremove commands? Well All is Well is here it will completely update the repository cache, upgrade all the packages and clean up at the end too. Works on all Linux and BSD distributions(RAW TXT file is provided for other distributions). Version 1.0 had some errors and has been removed.

# Important Note:
I am new to Linux,BSD and have recently learnt bash scripting, the above mentioned scripts are from my first attempt, so it may not be 100% correct :)
Feel free to edit the script according to your needs and create a pull request, incase of any errors.

# How to Execute/Run?
Executing the scripts are pretty easy, just open a terminal session and type chmod +x (script name) and hit enter or if you prefer GUI (may vary) then right click the script>properties>permissions and check "allow executing file as program". To launch from file manager double click the script and select "run in terminal"
To launch from terminal cd to the directory where the script is saved and then type ./script-name. Raspberry Pi users can get the script, with everything already setup from pi-apps

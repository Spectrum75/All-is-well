# All is Well Version 2.0:
Tired of typing update and upgrade commands again and again? Well All is Well is here it will completely update the repository cache, upgrade all the packages and clean up at the end too. Works on most of the Linux and BSD distributions (RAW TXT file is provided for other distributions). Version 1.0 had some errors and has been removed.

Feel free to edit the script according to your needs. Please note that the processes that the script needs to do takes some time (from a few minutes to an hour) depending on your internet connection and the number of packages/repositories. Do not interrupt the script once it is running as this may break your packages. 

# Installation:
Run the below command in a terminal to get the script up and running:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectrumgamer75/All-is-well/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && clear && ./install.sh`

You can either run the script from the menu shortcut, or directly from the terminal by using the `aiw` command. By default all output is cleared, to stop this edit the script (more info inside)

Raspberry Pi users can get the script, with everything already setup from pi-apps.

# Bash Scripts
This repository has some basic bash scripts that I created. There are two scripts in the repository:

# All is Well
Tired of typing sudo apt update and more update-upgrade commands? Well All is Well is here it will completely update the repository cache, upgrade all the packages and clean up at the end too. Works on Debian, Ubuntu, Arch and fedora.

# Vastro
Is your Raspberry pi stuck at maintainance screen, not booting or had a power cut in between and your pi closed abruptly? You should scan it with vastro, a small script that will scan your sd card and fix errors and bad sectors, if any. Vastro can also be used to fix normal sd cards and flash drives too!

# Important Note:
I am new to linux and have recently learnt bash scripting, the above mentioned script are from my first attempt, so it may not be 100% correct :)
Feel free to edit the script according to your needs and create a pull request, incase of any errors.

# Warning:
I am not responsible for any damage that may occur to your system by using these scripts.
